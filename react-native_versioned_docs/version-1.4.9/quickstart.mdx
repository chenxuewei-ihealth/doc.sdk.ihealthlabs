In this case, the static library files of the iHealth SDK are not added to the project and need to be manually added to the project. You can add them step by step in the order of the pictures.

You check if your .a file has been added to the project, if not, you manually add it, as in my screenshot

![integrate ios](/RN_ios_2.png)

Below this folder is the .a file
